								The textbook permanent-income hypothesis predicts that the level of consumption is proportional to the level of permanent income, while, 
								in the data, the elasticity of consumption to permanent income appears to be far below one. In this paper, I provide evidence for a novel 
								theory for this consumption under-response to permanent income based on <i>consumption commitments</i> -- hard-to-adjust consumption 
								choices that resemble long-term commitments. Empirically, I document four main new facts that support the theory: (a) the consumption 
								elasticity to permanent income is larger for younger households, (b) it depends on past income trajectories, and (c) it becomes larger 
								after households adjust their commitments; furthermore, I show that (d) those households that have "under-responded" to their income 
								growth skew spending away from hard-to-adjust goods (notably shelter). These facts are evidence in favor of household "lock-in" to past 
								consumption choices. Quantitatively, I show that consumption commitments are necessary for life-cycle models to account for all the documented facts.

								Job losses negatively affect children's labor market outcomes through decreases in family income. Since unemployed parents have more time available to invest in their children,
								the effects of parental unemployment on children’s future outcomes are ambiguous after accounting for this drop in income. Using NLSY79 and NLSY79-CYA, we show that the total
								amount of time a mother spends unemployed throughout her child's childhood has direct negative effects on the child’s future wage and employment probability, even conditional
								on family income. By contrasting these results with the weaker effects of mothers being out of the labor force and instrumenting for involuntary maternal non-employment, we
								suggest that the effects might be causal. We further show that maternal unemployment negatively impacts the quality of the home environment and that unemployed mothers
								allocate very little additional time to educating their children.

							<div id="abs_inflation" style="display: none;">
							<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 25px;">
								We study the inflation target level decision under a high government debt burden. Lower targets allow for lower on-target inflation but increase 
								the temptation to use extra inflation to generate fiscal revenue. We model this trade-off in an economy with an altruistic policymaker choosing 
								debt and public expenditure on behalf of private agents whom finance expenditures and form inflation expectations rationally. For low debt levels, 
								the inflation target is credible and always delivered. For high debt, the target is not credible and never delivered. In-between, the target may be
								delivered or not, leading to above-target expectations and expensive debt rollovers. We show that rollover costs are lower when the inflation target 
								is higher. Our model implies that the optimal inflation target depends on debt levels.

								We estimate cyclicality in labor's user cost allowing for cyclical fluctuations in the quality of worker-firm matches and wages that are smoothed within employment matches.
								To do so, we exploit a match's long-run wage to control for its quality. Using NLSY data for 1980 to 2019, we identify three channels by which recessions affect user cost:
								It lowers the new-hire wage; it lowers wages going forward in the match; but it also results in higher subsequent separations. All totaled, we find that labor's user cost
								is highly procyclical, increasing by more than 4% for a 1 pp decline in unemployment.

							<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 25px;">
								Recent business-cycle theories have relied on countercyclical increases in risk premiums to generate realistic cyclical fluctuations in unemployment. I propose a method to 
								identify the sources of this variation in risk premiums by estimating firm-specific discount rates using establishment-level panel data. My method relies on two steps. First, 
								I use Euler equations to estimate firms' discount rates from their observable employment flows. Second, I identify predictable patterns between movements of the estimated 
								discount factor and observable firm characteristics. Different mechanisms predict that different firms will display movements in discount factors, which allows the 
								identification of the sources of cyclical fluctuations in risk premiums. I will implement my method using restricted-use microdata from the Census Bureau. In particular, 
								I will combine employer-employee information from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) and Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) with cost information from 
								the Economic Census and annual surveys and balance sheet data from the Quarterly Financial Reports (QFR).

								I show that a combination of job search and job-specific human capital is needed to quantitatively account for the behavior of the hours’ profile, especially during workers’ early years in 
								the labor market. In the data, the hours' profile grows steeper and peaks before the wage profile, which has been seen as evidence favoring on-the-job human capital accumulation. I show,
								however, that a model with only general human capital overpredicts the labor supply at early ages, while a model with job-specific human capital and job search can better account for the 
								empirical evidence. Together, both forces lower the incentive to work since workers are likely to change jobs and lose the accumulated specific human capital. As a validation test, I show 
								that, as the model predicts, worked hours are positively associated with proxies for better match quality during a worker’s first three years in the labor market. Currently, I am working 
								on the quantitative model to perform a counterfactual exercise of decomposing life-cycle wage growth into contributions of human capital and job search.
