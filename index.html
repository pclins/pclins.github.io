									The textbook permanent-income hypothesis predicts that the level of consumption is proportional to the level of permanent income, while, 
									in the data, the elasticity of consumption to permanent income appears to be far below one. In this paper, I provide evidence for a novel 
									theory for this consumption under-response to permanent income based on <i>consumption commitments</i> -- hard-to-adjust consumption 
									choices that resemble long-term commitments. Empirically, I document four main new facts that support the theory: (a) the consumption 
									elasticity to permanent income is larger for younger households, (b) it depends on past income trajectories, and (c) it becomes larger 
									after households adjust their commitments; furthermore, I show that (d) those households that have "under-responded" to their income 
									growth skew spending away from hard-to-adjust goods (notably shelter). These facts are evidence in favor of household "lock-in" to past 
									consumption choices. Quantitatively, I show that consumption commitments are necessary for life-cycle models to account for all the documented 
									facts and explore implications for the aggregate distribution of income, consumption, and wealth.

									We study the long-term effects of maternal unemployment on children's labor market outcomes, emphasizing the role of non-monetary channels. 
									Using data from the NLSY79 and NLSY79-CYA, we document that children exposed to more maternal unemployment have lower wages and employment 
									probabilities in adulthood. Importantly, these effects persist even after controlling for family income, indicating that increased parental 
									time availability does not offset the scarring effects of job loss. We find that the negative effects are concentrated among older children, 
									suggesting that exposure to parental job loss during late schooling and early career years is particularly consequential. Specifically, we 
									show that children exposed to maternal unemployment are more likely to drop out of high school, less likely to graduate from college, and 
									more likely to select lower-return, lower-risk occupations in adulthood.

								We propose a model to study an inflation-targeting regime under a high government debt burden. We assume that an altruistic policymaker chooses debt issuance, 
								inflation, and public expenditure, while private agents dislike inflation and finance the government. We show that equilibrium inflation depends on debt level: 
								(1) on-target when debt is low; (2) above the target when debt is high; (3) either above or on-target in between, a zone that we named fiscal fragility. 
								Equilibrium inflation also depends on the target level: a higher target may improve welfare by preventing fiscal fragility and reducing debt-rollover costs.

								We estimate cyclicality in labor's user cost allowing for cyclical fluctuations in the quality of worker-firm matches and wages that are smoothed within employment matches.
								To do so, we exploit a match's long-run wage to control for its quality. Using NLSY data for 1980 to 2019, we identify three channels by which recessions affect user cost:
								It lowers the new-hire wage; it lowers wages going forward in the match; but it also results in higher subsequent separations. All totaled, we find that labor's user cost
								is highly procyclical, increasing by more than 4% for a 1 pp decline in unemployment.

								Recent business-cycle theories have relied on countercyclical increases in risk premiums to generate realistic cyclical fluctuations in unemployment. I propose a method to 
								identify the sources of this variation in risk premiums by estimating firm-specific discount rates using establishment-level panel data. My method relies on two steps. First, 
								I use Euler equations to estimate firms' discount rates from their observable employment flows. Second, I identify predictable patterns between movements of the estimated 
								discount factor and observable firm characteristics. Different mechanisms predict that different firms will display movements in discount factors, which allows the 
								identification of the sources of cyclical fluctuations in risk premiums. I will implement my method using restricted-use microdata from the Census Bureau. In particular, 
								I will combine employer-employee information from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) and Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) with cost information from 
								the Economic Census and annual surveys and balance sheet data from the Quarterly Financial Reports (QFR).

								We document new facts about the behavior of total annual hours worked over the life cycle using NLSY79 data and show which ingredients life-cycle models need to explain these facts.
								In the data, both the intensive and extensive margins of labor supply are equally important, each contributing close to 50% to the life-cycle growth in hours. 
								We propose a life-cycle model that nests different theories used to explain the hours' profile and calibrate it to reproduce our empirical evidence. 
								Both human capital accumulation and a job ladder are needed to account for the data patterns, while versions with only one ingredient fail to reproduce labor supply behavior. 
								Through counterfactual exercises, we find that human capital accumulation drives wage growth in the early stages of a worker's career, 
								while an interaction of job search and job-switching costs drives hours growth.
